automated data analysis pipeline
plot styles
plt.style.use(<style_name>)
style sheets reference
Seaborn software library - based on matplotlib

Choosing a style -> Dark bgs are discouraged
colorblind-friendly if colors are important - seaborn-colorblind or tableau-colorblind10
if printing then use less ink avoid more colors
if b/w printer use grayscale


Saving ur visualizations
fig.savefig(<filename.png/jpeg/appro extension>)
png - lossless compression
jpg - website lossy compression less diskspace and less bandwidth -- quality = 1, 100 avoid above 95
svg - different elements edited if fig needs to be edited
-- dpi dots per inch higher number denser the image larger the filesize will be
size of the fig
fig.set_size_inches([width, height])

Introduction to seaborn
	easily create most co
gather data -> transform and clean <-> explore -> analyze and build models -> communicate results

Advantages -> easy to use, works well with pandas, bulit on matplotlib
import seaborn as sns Samuel Norman Seaborn
also import matplotlib
countplot takes in categorical list
sns.countplot() -> gives out a bar chart
When to use type of visualization

Pandas - to analyze data
